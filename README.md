## Introduction
We provide code of safe control method - Safe Set Algorithm (SSA) and test it in a crowded dynamic environment.

## Install

```
pip install cvxopt
pip install tensorflow
```

## Usage

```
python main.py --no-ssa
python main.py --ssa
```
- `--no-ssa` means that ssa is not used.
- `--ssa` means that ssa is used for monitoring and modifying the unsafe control.

Train the RL policy with SSA and without SSA
```
python rl_main.py --no-ssa
python rl_main.py --ssa
```
- `--no-ssa` means that ssa is not used.
- `--ssa` means that ssa is used for monitoring and modifying the unsafe control.

Part of the simulation environment code is coming from the course CS 7638: Artificial Intelligence for Robotics in GaTech. We get the permission from the lecturor Jay Summet to use this code.
